# breathe - lightweight PDF viewer

Originally called "lpdf," this project is a rewrite soft fork in C. 
      https://lkrotowski.com/projects/lpdf
It was initially developed by Łukasz Krotowski in C++, but I have converted it to C. This version uses a more basic, minimal library, making it less unique and allowing it to run on multiple Linux distributions. Instead of requiring a specific version of a PDF engine, it relies solely on the Poppler engine. 
You can find more information at lkrotowski.com/projects/lpdf.
     
## 1. Building
bash
make

Dependencies are Xlib and poppler-glib.

Debian 
sudo apt-get install build-essential libpoppler-glib-dev libx11-dev pkg-config

Breathe uses the poppler-glib API. It has been built and tested with [Debian's libpoppler-glib-dev/unstable,now 24.08.0-2 amd64].

## 2. Installation

To install breathe (requires write access to /usr/local):
bash
sudo make install

This will copy the executable and man page to the appropriate directories.

## 3. Uninstallation

To uninstall breathe:
bash
sudo make uninstall

## 4. Customization

Breathe can be customized by modifying the `config.h` file and recompiling.

## 5. About the Name

The name "breathe" is inspired by the iconic Pink Floyd song from their 1973 album "The Dark Side of the Moon". Just as the song encourages listeners to take a moment and breathe, this lightweight PDF viewer aims to provide a simple, uncluttered reading experience[5].

## 6. License

Breathe is free software distributed under the terms of the Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License, Version 2.

## 6. Credits

Breathe is based on lpdf by Łukasz Krotowski (https://lkrotowski.com), with modifications and C port by Malcolm Reed.
